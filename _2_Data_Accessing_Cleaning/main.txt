  Data Accessing
In this step, the data is to be understood more deeply. Before implementing methods to clean it, you will 
definitely need to have a better idea about what the data is about.


Types of Unclean Data

There are 2 kinds of unclean data

DIRTY DATA (Data with Quality issues):
     Dirty data, also known as low quality data. Low quality data has content issues.

Duplicated data
Missing Data
Corrupt Data
Inaccurate Data


MESSY DATA (Data with tidiness issues):
     Messy data, also known as untidy data. Untidy data has structural issues.Tidy data has the following properties:

Each variable forms a column
Each observation forms a row
Each observational unit forms a table





import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

patients = pd.read_csv('patients.csv')
treatments = pd.read_csv('treatments.csv')
adverse_reactions = pd.read_csv('adverse_reactions.csv')
treatments_cut = pd.read_csv('treatments_cut.csv')


Process of doing

1. Write a summary for your data

This is a dataset about 500 patients of which 350 patients participated in a clinical trial. None of the patients were using 
Novodra (a popular injectable insulin) or Auralin (the oral insulin being researched) as their primary source of insulin before. 
All were experiencing elevated HbA1c levels.

All 350 patients were treated with Novodra to establish a baseline HbA1c level and insulin dose. 
After 4 weeks, which isnâ€™t enough time to capture all the change in HbA1c that can be attributed by the switch to Auralin or Novodra:

    175 patients switched to Auralin for 24 weeks
    175 patients continued using Novodra for 24 weeks
Data about patients feeling some adverse effects is also recorded.


2. Write Column descriptions

Table -> patients:
    patient_id: 
    assigned_sex: 
    given_name: 
    surname: 
    address: 
    city:
    state:
    zip_code: 
    country: 
    contact: 
    birthdate:
    weight: 
    height: 
    bmi:

Table -> treatments and treatment_cut:
    given_name: 
    surname: 
    auralin: 
    novodra: 
    hba1c_start:
    hba1c_end: 
    hba1c_change: 
Table -> adverse_reactions
    given_name: 
    surname: 
    adverse_reaction:


3. Add any additional information
    Additional useful information:

Insulin resistance varies person to person, which is why both starting median daily dose and ending median 
daily dose are required, i.e., to calculate change in dose.

It is important to test drugs and medical products in the people they are meant to help. 
People of different age, race, sex, and ethnic group must be included in clinical trials. 
This diversity is reflected in the patients table.




Types of Assessment

There are 2 types of assessment styles

    Manual - Looking through the data manually in google sheets
    Programmatic - By using pandas functions such as info(), describe() or sample()
