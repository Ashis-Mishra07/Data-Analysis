What actaully we do when we get any data ?
    i .  Data Gathering
    ii.  Data Cleaning
    iii. EDA


Q. What is Data Analysis ?
A. Data Analysis is a process of inspecting , Cleaning , tranforming and modeling 
   data with the goal of discovering useful information , informing conclusions and 
   supporting decision making .



The process of Data Analysis involves 
   Asking Questions 
   Data Wrangling ( means cleaning and sequncing the data for use)
   Exploratory Data Analysis 
   Drawing conclusions
   Communicating Results

1. Asking Questions depends on the knowledge on the topic you have on it , experinece u have on it.
2. Data Wrangling refers to as data munging in short if the data is not conveying any meaning to ur use
   then cleaning and collecting info is called __ .
   -> Involves process like Data Gathering (from DB , Api) , 
                            Data Assessing (how much memory , no of rows /cols , duplicate check) ,
                            Data Cleaning  ( removing missing data , remove duplicates , incorrect data type)

3. EDA , here u explore the data and better augment the data to easily work on it .
   -> Involves process like Exploring Data ( Finding correlation , Covariance , plotting graphs )
                            Augmenting Data ( removing outliers ,merging dataframes , adding new columns)

4. Drawing conclusions means can predict the data  by ML , Inferential Statistics , Descriptive Statistics
5. Communicating Results means showing the results in diff ways ppts , blogs , graphs , reports 


The 5 parts of Data Analysis are very Dangling , may be there is a chance to have a some process in between a process
so exporing and making it again is all about Analysis .
